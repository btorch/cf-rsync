rsync (2.6.4-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed grave bug:
    replaced the Debian-specific patch to log.c with the upstream CVS version,
    as upstream changes conflict with the Debian patch, causing syslog logging
    (the default!) to fail, meaning that for most people the rsync as daemon
    doesn't work.
    This includes people using systemimager-server, as that generates the
    rsyncd.conf on the fly without a log file line, hence the rsync bug
    causes a total failure of that package.
    closes:#307923,#308428
  * fixed the rsync.1 manpage, where cut&paste from a diff was not done

rsync (2.6.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed building on GNU/KNetBSD (by adding DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE and
    DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE settings after backwards compatibilty stuff in rules).
    closes:#223267
  * Experimental modification of --bwlimit option to limit the size of writes
    when using small bwlimit values. Use --bwlimit-mod instead of --bwlimit.
    Note that this needs an rsync version at both ends that has this
    modification. See bug 191557 for more info.
  * Removed own kludge to fix #146045 (interrupting while ssh is asking for a
    password leaves tty in non-echoing state) as upstream rsync now has its
    own kludge for this in another place.
  * Added init.d script for those who want to start rsync in daemon mode
    automatically. You'll need to edit /etc/default/rsync and create an
    appropriate rsyncd.conf file to actually get it to start.

rsync (2.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Year's Day official release of 2.6.0.
  * In short, the most important points from NEWS:
  * - ssh is now the default remote shell for rsync.
  * - Added --files-from, --no-relative, --no-implied-dirs, and --from0.
  * - Fixed several exclude/include matching bugs when using wild-cards.
      Please check the NEWS file for details on subtle changes in
      exclude/include matching.
  * - Make --link-dest honor the absence of -p, -o, and -g.
  * - Fixed file I/O error detection.
  * - Improved file-related error messages to better indicate exactly what
      pathname failed.
  * - Fixed bug that prevented regular files from replacing special files and
      caused a directory in --link-dest or --compare-dest to block the creation
      of a file with the same path.  A directory still cannot be replaced by a
      regular file unless --delete specified.  (J.W. Schultz)

    mode.
